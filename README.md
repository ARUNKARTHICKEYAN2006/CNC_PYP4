List & Dictionary Operations
==============================

📌 DESCRIPTION:
This Python program provides simple operations on lists and dictionaries such as merging, filtering, and transforming. 
It uses basic for-loops and avoids lambda, map, and filter for easier understanding — perfect for Python beginners.

🎯 FEATURES:
1. Merge two lists
2. Filter even numbers from a list
3. Square all numbers in a list
4. Merge two dictionaries
5. Filter dictionary items by value (greater than 2)
6. Double all dictionary values

👨‍💻 HOW TO RUN:
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save the script file (e.g., `list_dict_operations.py`).
3. Open terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script using:

   python list_dict_operations.py

5. Choose an option from the menu and follow prompts.

🔧 FUNCTION EXPLANATIONS:

• merge_lists(list1, list2)
  → Combines two lists into one.

• filter_even_numbers(numbers)
  → Returns a new list with only even numbers.

• square_numbers(numbers)
  → Returns a new list with each number squared.

• merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)
  → Combines two dictionaries; values in the second one overwrite duplicates.

• filter_dict_by_value(d)
  → Returns a dictionary with values greater than 2.

• double_dict_values(d)
  → Returns a dictionary where all values are doubled.

✅ EXAMPLE INPUT:
Enter first list (space-separated): 1 2 3
Enter second list (space-separated): 4 5 6
→ Output: Merged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

📎 NOTES:
- No external libraries are used.
- Ideal for educational use or practice projects.
